## 🚀 The Core Mission
This project was built to solve [X problem]. As a self-taught developer, I wanted to focus on creating a frictionless UI that mimics the student experience at Udemy, specifically focusing on **state persistence** and **performance optimization**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS (for responsive design)
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express
* **State Management:** React Context API / Redux
* **Optimization:** Custom hooks (Debouncing), Lazy Loading

## 🌟 Key Features
* **Progress Tracking:** Saves video timestamps to local storage so students never lose their place.
* **Smart Search:** Implemented a custom `useDebounce` hook to reduce API calls by 70%.
* **Mobile First:** Fully responsive grid layout for learning on the go.

## 🧠 Engineering Challenges & Lessons
* **Challenge:** Managing complex state across the video player and the course curriculum sidebar.
* **Solution:** I implemented [specific solution], which taught me the importance of lifting state and avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
